EventBriteApiClient is a fork of the EventBrite.NET repo, and will be an API wrapper for the event management site [eventbrite.com](http://eventbrite.com).

I will be focusing on implementing all of the API calls available on the EventBrite site, and representing the data as suitable classes for use in a .NET application, persisting data locally, and/or pushing data to the Eventbrite back-end.

I will be experimenting at first, and likely making breaking changes to the original implementation. However, according to the project owner, it is no longer being actively maintained, so hopefully I can expand on his original concept and update things a little. 


## Where is the REAL EventBrite.NET project?

Refer to the [original project homepage](http://penguinboy.github.com/Eventbrite.NET) for more detailed usage information.
